THE HANGED SNAKE GAME
- Developed by Camille Nguyen

Principles of the game:
In this game, you will be able to play as a snake wandering the confines of a small room. 
You will find in this room some letters, which you will need to create a magical word.
If you manage to complete the word, congratulations, you win!

However, be careful of crashing into the walls or into yourself (the snake can feel pain, too)...
